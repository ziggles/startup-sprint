# Startup Sprint

This is a partially finished app with a ton of work left in the backlog.
It's up to you and your teammates to generate as much velocity as you
can!

## Overview

The backlog is here in this [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Wk9YRL5H/flatiron-school-vfa-2015#).

From the menu on the right, copy the Trello board to one of your own.
Then start looking through the cards and picking out the ones that seem
most cost effective to implement for your team.

## Getting Started

Fork and clone this lab. You'll probably want to add your team mates as
collaborators on your Github repo so that you can collaborate. Watch out
for merge conflicts though!

You'll need to run `bundle install` to install all the necessary Ruby
gems.

Start the server with the `rackup` command, you can then view it at
"http://localhost:9292".
